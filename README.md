This is a program that opens a fullscreen window that changes to a random color at a random interval*, when the mouse is clicked, when the mouse is scrolled, and when a key is pressed. 
The supported languages are python and C, both in souce code and precompiled. Other languages will be added in the future.
for the Python version the number of mouse buttons coded in is 5*. It works with less, but if you have more you will have to change line 79 in Screensaver.py to however many buttons you have.
To exit the window, press Esc.
To install the requirements, run the command pip install -r requirements.txt


*Only in Python version
